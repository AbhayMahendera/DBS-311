# Database Project with SQL, PL/SQL, and C++ Integration

## Overview
Welcome to the Database Project repository, a comprehensive solution developed for Assignment 2. This project focuses on expanding an existing database design to better support a business application, integrating SQL, PL/SQL, and C++ technologies. The result is a robust system that seamlessly combines the power of a relational database with the versatility of a C++ interface.

## Repository Structure
- **/src**: Source code files reside here.
  - **`studentname_a2_cpp.cpp`**: Individual C++ files for each group member.
  - **`groupname_a2_cpp.cpp`**: Combined C++ file for the entire group.
- **/docs**: Documentation files are stored here.
  - **`studentname_a2_output.docx`**: Individual output documentation.
  - **`groupname_a2_output.docx`**: Combined output documentation.
- **/demo**: Materials for the online demo are available here.
  - **`demo_presentation.pdf`**: Presentation slides for the online demo.

## How to Run
1. Open the C++ files in an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio or Code::Blocks.
2. Ensure Oracle SQL Developer is set up and connected to the database.
3. Compile and run the C++ program, following the prompts to perform various database operations.
